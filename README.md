Cryptography challenges from Cryptopals
https://cryptopals.com/

This is a work in progress, and I plan to add to it in my free time.

I am currently doing all the challenges in C to get better at C programming.  I plan to do the challenges in Python, as well.

I am new to programming and have been self-learning C and Python since early 2016.  The code in this repository may not be the most elegant, but I'm learning! :)
